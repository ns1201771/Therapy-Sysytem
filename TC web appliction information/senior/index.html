        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
            Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder manifested by widespread muscular pain in the body that affects patient’s life,
            disrupted sleep and it can lead to depression. There are no specific devices made to treat fibromyalgia patients,
            but studies show that they need regular exercises to overcome their pain through gradual elevation of the pain thresholds.
            However, the pain associated with fibromyalgia makes even the simple daily movements very difficult.
            Most of fibromyalgia patients are not physically fit and they even avoid doing exercises.
            Since exercises are one of the most important treatments for fibromyalgia, our goal in this project is
            to make the patient do regular exercise, in a manner that the level of difficulty is increased gradually in phases.
            This is done through a modified exercise cycle with speed control and virtual reality technology such that the patient
            is more involved in the activity and it distracts the mind from the fear of pain which helps the patient in performing the
            required exercises. In the early stages of the exercise schedule, the patient will not do any work and the cycle is
            controlled by the software to move at certain speed based on a VR game scenario that motivates the brain to try to
            follow the required exercise passively. This will increase the body’s production of endorphin, i.e., natural pain
            killers that also boost mood. In the next phases, the patient will be more active and will start to move the cycle by
            himself/herself while enjoying the interactive game with the exercise.

        <h4>Project significance</h4>
       <p>
           Living with fibromyalgia is not only living with a chronic pain and making the movement difficult,
           it has also some dramatic effects on family, work and social life. Fibromyalgia patients feel helpless and powerless.
           They fearful of pain that is resulted from the physical exercise that they should to do it to relieve pain.
           They need to think that the pain that is resulted from exercises is only short-term pain.

        Benefits of the project in Qatar
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a significantly large number of cases that reported in HMC in Qatar.
        In addition to the usual clinical factors leading to the disorder, it is believed that the low physical activity
        lifestyle plays an important role to have aggravated this situation in Qatar. Therefore, having a machine with a
        low cost and suitable size that helps the patients to do their exercise at home and in their own time with the use of
        virtual reality would make them more comfortable and their exercises more enjoyable.
